## About

A man may live his whole life and never hold power in his hands - real power.
And then, one day, power might just drop onto his lap.  Did you ever hear the
story about the shitfisher, Julian?

This old shitfisher took his bagpipes down to the river, and he played his pipes
in the hopes that the shitfish would rise up out of the water.  But not one
shitfish rose, Julian!  So he took a shitnet and threw it in the river, and lo,
soon, he drew it forth, filled with shitfish!  And he took his bagpipes and he
played 'em again.  And all the shitfish jumped up in the shitnet.

"Oh, you dance _now_ when I play?" said the shitfisher.

And then the little old shitfish poked up at the end, he said, "When you're in a
man's power, you must do as he bids you!"
